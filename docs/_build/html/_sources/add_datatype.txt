.._add_datatype: 

============================
Add a new datatype 
============================

The Shiny Browse-R is easily customizable to show data from a new platform; all that is required is the addition of a platform-specific .R file in the code directory. For illustration, let us suppose we want to add a new datatype of 450K microarrays.

These steps will allow a new 'datatype' value to be specified in a :ref:`dataset config <add-data-config>` file. In our example, let that datatype be "FourFiftyK".

#. Create FourFiftyK.R in the ``data_types`` directory; the latter is at the same level with ui.R and server.R)
#. In FourFiftyK.R, create an R function, fetchData_base() with the following signature::

	fetchData_base <- function
	(
	pheno, 		##<<(data.frame) phenotype matrix
	selRange, 	##<<(GRanges) range being viewed on browser
	numBins,	##<< (integer) num. bins
	aggFUN
	) {
		# fetch code goes here.
	
	### (list)
	}
Blah blah
