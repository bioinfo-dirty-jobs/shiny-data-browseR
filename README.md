====================
Welcome to the repo for the Epigenome Data Browse-R (EDB), an interactive statistical explorer for population (but also other) genomics.


For documentation visit  http://readthedocs.org.

For an online demo, visit http://intangiblearts.org:8180/ 
*** Note: This demo is quite slow as it is currently running off a single-processor laptop.
An Amazon instance with a faster demo is expected to be available in early September 2014.
