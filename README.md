====================
**Welcome to the repo for the Epigenome Data Browse-R (EDB), an interactive statistical explorer for population (but also other) genomics.**

#### For documentation visit  http://shiny-genome-browse-r.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.

#### For an online demo, visit http://edb.intangiblearts.org/ 
_(faster data fetch, but on an Amazon spot instance which may occasionally be unavailable)_
#### OR  http://intangiblearts.org:8180/EDB 
_(slower but reliable)_

An EDB demo is expected to be hosted at the CAMH in September 2014. Stay tuned!
