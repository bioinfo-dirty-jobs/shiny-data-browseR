* group_order: what happens when group order is not specified for a group? It should just use alphanum order.
* Remove functions specific to datatype handler whenever a new dataset is loaded.
* error bars not working for grouping type = "age group" 
* plot title needs to be formatted more nicely.
* Bug: error bar polygon doesn't render correctly. e.g. mTAG dataset when view spans centromere.
* Bug: mTAG, zoom in doesn't change the numerical.
* Doc: Gviz install should be of custom Gviz package. 
* Configuring shiny. shiny-server is (probably?) not required. For shiny < 0.9.0, runApp("myApp", port=XXXX) works. For shiny 0.9.0 runApp("myApp",port=XXXX, host="0.0.0.0") is required.

Nice feature:
* save plot to pdf with all parameters stated.
* Make starting chrom/pos custom to config file.
* Allow mc.cores to be a global parameter.
	* config file: remove name_color
	* config file: add platform name variable
	* config file: add comments above each flag name.
